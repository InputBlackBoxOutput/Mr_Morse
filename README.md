## What is Morse code?
Morse code is an old encoding scheme for roman alphabets and some special characters used during the times of telegraph communication.
Even though it is old it is still used when all other communications fail. 

Learning morse code will give you a way to communicate at larger distances with just a torch or a whistle. 
Moreover, it will not be understood by those who don't know it.
